# Challenge3-1-

This challenge had me make a password generator based on user desired criteria. User could choose between how long they want to make the password and what characters they want to use. The password generator tool will make them a password, they can click the botton and do it as many times as they desire. The website will also not let users pogress trhough the multiple choice sections if their input is invalid.
